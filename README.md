# The Language Survival Game  

## About the App  
This is a small interactive **web app** built with **React** and bundled with **Vite**.  
Itâ€™s a silly twist on the classic **Hangman game**, but instead of saving a stick figure, youâ€™re fighting to keep **high-level programming languages** alive so youâ€™re not left in a world with only Assembly language.
You start with a squad of languages (JavaScript, Python, CSS, etc.) and have **8 attempts** to guess before losing them all and therefore losing the game.  
Whenever you lose a language, youâ€™ll get a cheeky message like:  

> *"Gone but not forgotten, CSS."*  

The messages are randomized each time, so youâ€™ll never know exactly how your fallen comrade will be memorialized.  

When all hope is lost and only **Assembly** remains then it is:  
**Game Over.**  and you get a message 

> *"You lose! Better start learning Assembly ðŸ˜­"*'
